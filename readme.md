# Wordle Letter Counter

A simple Python script that goes through the Wordle word list and **counts how many times each letter appears.**

See the results [here](https://www.craft.do/s/HB6QVxLpw5uQuL/b/C14B0D92-8120-4CAB-B62F-0DCA4EFE6A3F/Top_Letters_Used_in_Wordle).

**UPDATE 1:** 16 Feb 2022

Added the revised list by the New York Times, see nyt_list.py

Updated main.py to work with both the original Wordle list and the NYTimes list
