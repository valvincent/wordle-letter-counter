# Wordle Letter Counter

A simple Python script that goes through the Wordle word list and **counts how many times each letter appears.**

**UPDATE 1:** 16 Feb 2022

Added the revised list by the New York Times, see nyt_list.py

Updated main.py to work with both the original Wordle list and the NYTimes list
